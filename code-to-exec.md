# The Underlying Hardware #
- OSs provide software access to hardware through abstractions
- A chipset block diagram proovides a general setup for the hardware that executes the instructions

## A Processor ##
- A circuit that does logical operations and stores values in registers (Local Memory)
- Most recently accessed data stored in cache
- Two special registers
    1. Program Counter --> points to next instruction
    2. Stack Pointer --> Contains memory addres of current thread's stack
