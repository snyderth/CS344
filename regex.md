## Finding Things ##
- find a file by name and locate it
```
find -regex "*filename*"
```

## Locate ##
- keeps a database of all the files in the computer
- Faster than find since it donesn't need to go throught the actual directory
- Not available for all OSs
- Operates differently on those systems
